    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; color: #111; margin-bottom: 15px;">

      I built The Iron Manual for guys like I used to be — stuck in the gym grind, doing everything I thought was right, but getting nowhere. It’s the shortcut I wish I had: clear, simple advice that actually works. I cover training, nutrition, recovery, mindset, and lifestyle — all the things that matter when you want real, lasting results. No fluff, no guesswork, just straight answers and a plan that actually delivers. If you're sick of spinning your wheels and ready to level up, this is where that starts.
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; max-width: 500px; margin: 20px auto; font-size: 1.1rem;">
      <li>✅ One-off payment, no subscriptions</li>
      <li>✅ 100+ manuals across training, nutrition, supplements, lifestyle and recovery</li>
      <li>✅ Easy to read, even easier to apply</li>
    </ul>
